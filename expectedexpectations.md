# Expected Expectations

This is a document I always write when I start to work with a new direct report or join a new company. It’s the single most valuable exercise I’ve always kept over the years, which is key to align expectations and ways of working between two individuals that don’t know each other well and have to work together every day.

## What I expect from you?

- To know your stakeholders and understand what their needs and challenges are
- To act with integrity and take ownership
- To place the company’s strategy and goals as your first priority
- To always do what you said you were going to do
- To keep all company official communication channels updated and be empathetic and respectful in all your interactions with colleagues
- Talk professionally about the company at all times
- Approach me directly if you ever feel threatened or disrespected in any way by a working colleague
- To be proactive, share your knowledge and help your colleagues whenever you see an opportunity
- To always strive to identify opportunities for improvement
- To be on time for all your appointments and make sure your team knows if you are not able to work
- Approach me whenever you find a problem you feel you can't solve on your own, as early as possible
- To treat everyone in the company fairly and with empathy, despite their nationality, gender or religion

## What I don't expect from you?

- To build knowledge or processes that transforms you in a blocker or single point of failure for others
- To answer any e-mails or messages I send outside working hours or during the weekend. The fact that I prefer to work in a certain way does not oblige you in any way to do the same
- To address me with formality or rank

## What you can expect from me?

- Clear, instant and honest feedback
- To be a perfectionist and continuously challenge you to be better every day
- To remain calm and provide clear directions under stressful situations
- Find the help you need whenever something blocks your work
- To always treat you fairly and never judge you before we have the chance to talk

## What you can't expect from me?

- To take decisions on your behalf
- To read your mind
- To control your time 
- To behave as a micro manager
